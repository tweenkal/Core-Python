# ðŸ‘‰Assign value in one line with two varibles
a,b = 4,3

# ðŸ‘‰3)Unary operator:-

# ðŸ‘‰4)Relational Operator :- < , > , <= , >= , == , !=

# ðŸ‘‰5)Logical Operators := &&(AND)  , ||(OR) , !(not)
c = 3
d = 5

# ðŸ‘‰And:-
print(c < 10 and d > 20)
print(c < 10 and d < 20)

# ðŸ‘‰OR
print(c < 10 or d > 20)

# NOT :- 0 = 1 , 1 = 0
x = True

print(y)

# ðŸ‘‰Bitwise Operator :- AND(&) , OR(||) , XOR(^) , Complement(~) or tilde ,
#                       left shift(<<) , right shift(>>)

# ðŸ‘‰Complement(~) :- means reverse for the binary format

print(~12)

# ðŸ‘‰AND(&) :-
print(12 & 13)  #12

# ðŸ‘‰OR( | ):-
print(12 | 13) #13

# ðŸ‘‰XOR(^) :-

# 0 0 0
# 1 0 1
# 0 1 1
# 1 1 0

print(12 ^ 13)   #1


# ðŸ‘‰Left shift(<<)
print(10 << 2)

# ðŸ‘‰Right shift(>>)

# ðŸ‘‰Identity Operator:-
# 1)is 2)is not :- it is check the two variable value same or not.

a = 10
b = 10

print(a is b)
print(a is not b)

# ðŸ‘‰Membership operator
# 1)in 2)not in :- it is check value is sequance or not and charcter
# is present in variable or not then character is present the variable
# and their sequance then it is true otherwise false.

c = "hello"
print('h' in c)  #True
print('hl' in c)  #False because it not a sequance.

list = [1,"hi",False,7]
print('h' in list)   #Fale because it not search a particular one element .

print('hi' in list)

# ðŸ‘‰Notes:-
# ðŸ‘‰Difference between the logical and bitwise operator.
# ðŸ‘‰Logical operator are used for any operator like int , string etc.
# ðŸ‘‰Bitwise operator are only work for int.
# ðŸ‘‰bitwise operator are used to perform bitwise calculation on
# integer.the integers are first converted into binary and then
# operations are perform are each bit or corrosponding pair of bits.
