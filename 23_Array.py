# ğŸ‘‰Array is the similar to the list but one difference you need to all
# the value have same type.
# ğŸ‘‰here all the value have a same type
# ğŸ‘‰array in python we not have the fixed size
# ğŸ‘‰array is not a by default this import the module for import array
# ğŸ‘‰ * means is work for the all function
# ğŸ‘‰In array is used to the buffer_info() function this give the size
# of the array
# ğŸ‘‰different different method in the array like insert,append ,reverse
# ,remove,pop,clear etc..

# ğŸ‘‰signed int(i) : it is access the positive and negative number both.
# ğŸ‘‰unsigned int(I) :- it is access only the positive number not a negative number.
