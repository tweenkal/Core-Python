# ðŸ‘‰Modules :- one big software and one files you will braking down for
# small small parts

# ðŸ‘‰if you imagine the ABCD is the big software and its break down
# the small parts A C and B D and it is a break down and build the
# 4 module like A C B D.if you want to change something A it not effecting
# the other module because they are saprate  now

# ðŸ‘‰It is break down the project into small small parts

# ============================================================================
# modules :- A module in Python is just a file that contains Python code

# two type of modules :- 1)built in modules 2)External modules
