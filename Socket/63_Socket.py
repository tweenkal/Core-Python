# ğŸ‘‰Sockets:-
# ğŸ‘‰Socket programming with the help of the python
# ğŸ‘‰Socket programming used for the two things :-1)Server 2)Client
# ğŸ‘‰2 concepts :- 1)Port number 2)Types of connection to build

# ğŸ‘‰1)port number :-
# ğŸ‘‰Server are give the IP address to intract the internet with help of
# the IP address.
# ğŸ‘‰every machine are define the different port number.

# ğŸ‘‰2)Types of connection:-
# ğŸ‘‰1)TCP :- Transmission control protocol
# ğŸ‘‰TCP is the connection oriented network
# ğŸ‘‰It is the first create the connection and then only  communicate.


# ğŸ‘‰2)UDP :-User datagram protocol
# ğŸ‘‰UDP is the connection less network
# ğŸ‘‰ It is not create a connection.


#ğŸ‘‰  A socket is like a virtual cable that connects two computers
# (or programs) so they can send and receive data between them.

# ğŸ‘‰ In Python, the socket module allows you to create these connections
# easily.

#ğŸ‘‰  Think of it like phones:
# ğŸ‘‰ When two people want to talk, they both pick up a phone (open a socket)
# and start speaking (send data).

# A socket is an endpoint â€” one side of a connection.
# It can be client side (sending a request) or server side (waiting to accept a request).
# Python provides a socket module to work with networking (like TCP/IP, UDP, etc.).
