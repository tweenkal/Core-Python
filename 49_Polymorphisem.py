# ðŸ‘‰Polymorphism :- is break down the word poly + morphism .poly means
# many and morph means form that means one think can multiple forms.objects
# have multiple form
# ðŸ‘‰4 ways of implementing polymorphism
# ðŸ‘‰1)duck typing 2)operator overloading
# 3)method overloading 4)method overriding.

# ðŸ‘‰Duck typing:-
# ðŸ‘‰means this is a bird is walking like a duck , swimming like a duck and
# quacks like a duck that it is probably bird is a duck

# ðŸ‘‰Method overloading :- is not there in python means two method have a
# same name but argument must be different.

# ðŸ‘‰method overriding :- same name and same parameter
